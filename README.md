      <td>
        <p><strong>Course Closure Event</strong> -  In the event that NZQA decides that Developers Institute is no longer delivering or capable of delivering the course for which students are enrolled. Should Developers Institute's refund policies fail, then the student fee protection mechanism(s) will be triggered. This includes students who have enrolled and paid but have not yet started the course.</p>
          <p><strong>Enrolment Cancellation</strong> -  An enrolment cancellation is the withdrawal of a student from a programme or course(s) without academic penalty. An enrolment cancellation may be initiated by Developers Institute or by the student concerned.</p>
          <p>An enrolment cancellation is a form of withdrawal, as defined by the Tertiary Education Commission Rules. The student enrolment will not be reported in the Single Data Return (SDR).</p>
          <p><strong>The Last Withdrawal Date</strong> - occurs when 60% of the course is completed. If
a student withdraws from a programme or course(s) before this date their
Academic Record will show “Withdrawn” for the course(s).</p>
          <p><strong>Non-Starter</strong> - A student who does not attend or engage in learning within the first 15 working days (three weeks) of a course or programme. For courses/programmes longer than 8 weeks but shorter than 12 weeks this time period is 10 working days (two weeks).</p>
